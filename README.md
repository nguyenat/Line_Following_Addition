# Line_Following_Addition
This code was used in my class at CU Denver to writing a program that will follow a specific path with right angles. I used code from Exp6_2_LineFollowing_IRSensors -- RedBot Experiment 6_2 and added additions to the code. I used the SparkFun Redbot Basic Kit robot. 

The robot itself had the ability to follow the lines using its IR Sensors, but the moment all three of the sensors hovered over the color black it would immediately stop. I wanted to use the encoders in the Redbot to calculate how far along the destined path to go and also when to turn.
